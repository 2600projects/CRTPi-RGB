# This is a Fork of the CRTPi-RGB Fork
The Fork is intended to be a spot to make changes related to my own projects without interfering with and cluttering up the main CRTPi-RGB Project branch.
For more information, see the original Readme farther below for the list of people who really worked on this project.

_____

**Instructions: This is recommended to be installed on a fresh Retropie install on a 3B or 3B+ using the 4.6 official image. Anything you overwrite is your own fault at this point!**



    **Start with the RPI without the adapter plugged in using an HDMI Monitor**
    Install Retropie
    Connect to WiFi or Ethernet with internet access
    Update Retropie and the underlying OS using Retropie-Setup  (A kernel upgrade changed the audio layout and the zips account for that)
    Install any Optional Prerequisites
    Download the CRTPi-RGB-2600.zip into your root folder (cd /) with the command "sudo wget https://github.com/2600projects/CRTPi-RGB/raw/master/CRTPi-RGB-2600.zip" 
    ***WARNING: THE NEXT STEP WILL OVERWRITE GAMELIST.XML FILES AS SHOWN IN THE REPRO! BACK UP ACCORDINGLY!!***
    Unzip and overwrite files with the command "sudo unzip -o -q CRTPi-RGB-2600.zip"
    Remove the zip with the command "sudo rm CRTPi-RGB-2600.zip"
    Power off the Pi with the command "sudo poweroff" and remove power once the green light stops blinking
    Install any 2600 RPi Adapter
    **At this point, HDMI will no longer be used**
    Put SD card back in Pi and power on while connected to your output device
    Drop to the command line or connect via SSH
    
    **Need to add Instructions to change ownership to all files and emulationstation directory files**
    Restore read/write access to the files you have overwritten with the command  "sudo chmod a+rw -R /opt/retropie/configs/"
    Restore execute access to the runcommand scripts with the command "sudo chmod a+rwx /opt/retropie/configs/all/*.sh"
	Launch into RetroPie-Setup with the command "sudo ~/RetroPie-Setup/retropie_setup.sh"
	Go to "Configuration/Tools > resetromdirs" and run it
	Choose "Perform Reboot" from the menu to reboot your Pi.

The RGB fork is now utilizing Snap-Shader, plus a newly-enhanced runcommand-onstart script, with provision for *user-specified per-game configuration*! 

**Here's the new script:**

    https://github.com/crtpi/CRTPi-RGB/blob/master/runcommand-onstart-NEW.sh

**Here's information about Snap-Shader:**

    https://github.com/ektgit/snap-shader-240p

**And here's a quick rundown on how it works:**

Not only does the new script carry forward the per-core scripting for 2048x / 1920x / and 1600x resolutions -- but adds per-game scripting by adding a text file to the system config and naming the rom(s) within the file. This allows you to force 2048x on a system that defaults to 1920x, or the other way around. This is especially useful for PSX, FDS, PCE/PCE-CD, and MAME for the few games that are 256 or 512 wide. Below are some example config files:

**/opt/retropie/conifgs/psx/256.txt**

    Brave Prove
    Castlevania - Symphony of the Night
    Crash Bandicoot
    Final Fantasy Origins
    Final Fantasy Tactics

**/opt/retropie/conifgs/megadrive/256.txt**

    Bubble And Squeak
    Bubsy in - Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind 
    Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble 
    Caesars Palace 
    Captain America and the Avengers 
    
 
**/opt/retropie/conifgs/fds/320.txt**

    Akumajou Dracula
    Donkey Kong
    Otocky
    Super Mario Brothers 2

You get the jist. It doesn't need an extension, but should match the rom name including punctuation. This forces them to launch in 2048x240p instead of the default 1920x240p, or vise versa. This gives the end user full control on a game-per-game basis over the horizontal integer. You'll still need to write a retroarch game config to override the defaults there, but this at least gets you the right field. For games with odd/shifting vertical resolutions (like Chrono Cross, Battle Arena Toshinden, Castlevania SotN, etc.), a single pass of snap-shader is applied (snap-basic, nearest neighbor filtering, and "don't care" scale).

**Final Thoughts:**

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or issues -- please PM me or DM me on Reddit or post on one of the threads. Chances are, it's a "feature" not a "bug." :)
